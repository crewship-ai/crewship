const crewshipSystemPreamble = `You are running inside a Crewship agent container.
Your working directory IS the output directory -- files you create or edit here are immediately visible to the user in the Files panel.

FILESYSTEM:
- HOME (~/) = /crew/agents/{your-slug}/ — persistent, personal (config, memory)
- Working dir = /output/{your-slug}/ — visible in Files panel
- Shared crew space = /crew/shared/ — all crew members can read/write
- Secrets = /secrets/{your-slug}/ — read-only credential files (one file per credential, named by env var)
- Scratch = /workspace/ — temporary, not persistent
Do NOT attempt to write outside these directories -- the filesystem is read-only elsewhere.

CREDENTIALS:
- CLI tokens and secrets are available as files in /secrets/{your-slug}/ (e.g., /secrets/{your-slug}/GH_TOKEN)
- The .env file in /secrets/{your-slug}/.env maps env var names to file paths
- API keys for LLM providers are injected automatically via the sidecar proxy

EXPOSE PORT (show a running server to the user):
- When you run a TCP server inside this container (HTTP, dev preview, etc.) the user
  cannot reach it directly because the container has no host port mapping.
- To get a public URL the user can paste into their browser, call the sidecar:
    curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9119/expose-port \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"port": <port>, "description": "<short why>"}'
- Response: {"token": "...", "url": "http://<host>/exposed/<token>/", "expires_at": "..."}
- Share the "url" field with the user. It expires in 1 hour by default; pass
  "ttl_seconds": N to request a different TTL (max 24h). The URL is a capability
  — anyone with it reaches the server, so avoid posting it to public channels.
- Bind your server to 0.0.0.0 (not 127.0.0.1) so the reverse proxy can reach it.

// BuildCLICommand constructs the CLI command and arguments for the configured
// adapter. The actual per-adapter logic lives in adapter_<name>.go files
// implementing the CLIAdapter interface; this function is a thin dispatch
// wrapper preserved so callers (orchestrator_run.go, exec_test.go,
// failover_test.go) keep working unchanged after the interface refactor.
//
// Supported adapters as of 2026-05:
//   - CLAUDE_CODE   — Anthropic's `claude` CLI (Max subscription or API key)
//   - CODEX_CLI     — OpenAI's `codex` (ChatGPT Plus/Pro or API key)
//   - GEMINI_CLI    — Google's `gemini` (Google AI Pro/Ultra or API key)
//   - OPENCODE      — sst.dev's `opencode` (BYOK any provider)
//   - CURSOR_CLI    — Cursor's `cursor-agent` headless mode
//   - FACTORY_DROID — Factory's `droid exec` autonomous runs
//
// Aider, Copilot CLI, Cody CLI, Replit Agent are intentionally NOT here:
// either too pair-programming-shaped, IDE-tied, browser-only, or shipping
// breaking changes too aggressively to integrate cleanly right now.
